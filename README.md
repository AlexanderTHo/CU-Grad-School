# Graduate Projects Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio of final projects from the University of Colorado Boulder (SKO BUFFS!) Graduate Program. This repository showcases a variety of projects focused on Machine Learning and Data Science, reflecting my specialization in this field.

Throughout my graduate studies, I have undertaken numerous challenging courses, and this portfolio is a testament to the knowledge and skills I've acquired. As I continue to grow, I will add more projects and files to demonstrate the depth and intensity of my coursework.

Please note that some files are missing due to changes in CU's agreement with Google Docs, which unfortunately led to the loss of some documents. However, I remain committed to updating this repository with comprehensive documentation of my skills and academic journey.
